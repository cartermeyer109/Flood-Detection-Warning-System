This project is to create a prototype of a flood detection warning system that notifies its
users of rising water levels. The goal is to help owners of real estate to initiate an early
response to potential water damages on their property. The harm of a flood includes
long-term damages such as structural, electrical, and furnishing damages as well as the
financial costs of repairing said damages. A flood can mean a disruption of
operations in a business, meaning loss of income, and potentially a need for a
temporary relocation. This project works to remedy these dangers. This
prototype includes a primary container which will have water pumped into it to 
demonstrate rising water levels, and a secondary container to pump water back into 
as a flood countermeasure. In the primary container is a device for
detecting the water level and a water pumping device. The water pumping device
continuously pumps water from the primary container to the secondary container. By
filling the primary container with water faster than it can be pumped out we will
demonstrate an environment where water is rising faster than it can be removed. The
board connected to these devices connects to a WiFi network to send email
notifications if the water rises above a certain level. The early detection of a flood with
this model will allow property owners to implement flood-prevention measures and
evacuate, if necessary, ahead of time. This early response will save costs for the
property owner by minimizing flood damages. Lastly, it will give peace of mind knowing
that an alert will be sent in case of a flood. Ultimately, this project demonstrates the
importance of applying IoT devices to create innovations that better peopleâ€™s lives. This
flood detection warning system is a type of environmental monitoring that is meant to
protect its users by working to help save you, your properties, and your visitors.
